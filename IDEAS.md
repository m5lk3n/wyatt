# Ideas

- time-based option
- *approaching*: when you're reaching LOC, then do this (e.g., scheduled road closure, make sure to take detour into consideration)
- *static*: when you stay [for DURATION] in this LOC, then do that
- *leaving*: when you've left LOC for DURATION, then do this (e.g., "after 10 days, remember to reconnect with your friends and family when you're away from home")
