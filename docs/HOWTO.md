# How to

## Print the Wireframe (to PDF/PNG)

1. Open "moqup" in Chrome (not Firefox) to properly print it to PDF
2. -> Preview (make sure it's set to 100% zoom, but so that the zoom widget (lower left corner) is hidden)
3. -> Fullscreen
4. Chrome -> Print -> Save as PDF
   - Portrait
   - A3
   - Scale: Custom: 46 (or whatever makes the picture fit fully)
   - No Background Graphics
5. Save as `wireframe.pdf` to download the PDF

Optional: On Linux, run `pdftoppm -png wireframe.pdf wireframe` to create the PNG file(s).
