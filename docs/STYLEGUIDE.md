# Material Styleguide

- [Buttons](https://m1.material.io/components/buttons.html#buttons-usage):

  *Place the affirmative button on the left, the dismissive button on the right. Buttons are best placed on the left side of a card to increase their visibility. However, as cards have flexible layouts, buttons may be placed in a location suited to the content and context, while maintaining consistency within the product.*
